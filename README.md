# Make a connection
jk <- jenkins(server = 'http://jenkins.ropensci.org', username = 'jeroen')

# Do stuff
jk$server_info()
jk$project_build('magick')

# It's now in the queue
jk$queue_list()

# Check build status
jk$build_info('magick')

# Get latest build log
jk$build_log('magick', build_id = 'lastCompletedBuild')
```
